# Sherlog-parser Documentation

Welcome to the Sherlog-parser documentation! This powerful tool uses machine learning to automatically cluster and extract patterns from log files, making log analysis more efficient and insightful.

## Overview

Sherlog-parser is designed to handle large-scale log analysis with intelligent pattern recognition. It combines modern machine learning techniques with efficient data processing to provide meaningful insights from your log files.

## Key Features

### üß† Intelligent Log Clustering
- Uses state-of-the-art embeddings for semantic understanding
- Implements incremental clustering for efficient processing
- Automatically groups similar log messages

### üéØ Pattern Extraction
- Automatically extracts regex patterns from log clusters
- Identifies common log patterns
- Helps in log standardization

### ‚ö° High Performance
- Efficient caching of embeddings using `diskcache`
- Incremental clustering with scikit-learn
- Batch processing for large log files
- Optimized for production workloads

### üè≠ Production Ready
- Type-safe with Pydantic models
- Configurable via YAML and environment variables
- Extensive test coverage
- Proper error handling and logging

### üîÑ Advanced Pipeline
- Built with Dagster for robust pipeline orchestration
- Visual pipeline UI for debugging and monitoring
- Automatic dependency management
- Asset tracking and materialization
